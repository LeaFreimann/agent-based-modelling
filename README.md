# Agent-based Modelling

This content is ready to go! As usual, create a CodeSpace or work locally use the DevContainers plugin and Docker Desktop. The virutal environment should be selected by default this time, so try running the code right away. ðŸ˜Ž If not, select the Poetry environment. It make need a couple of minutes to fully load.

Note that some cells in the notebook will take time to run, especially when doing large batch runs and sensitivity analyses. We should be able to run code in the live session together without issue.

See you in class!
